An Android app that reads ingredients labels and alerts the user of any
ingredients that may conflict with their dietary restrictions/allergies. 

## Key Features
- allows the user to set their allergies/dietary restrictions
  - allergies:
	- egg
    - gluten
    - milk
    - nut
    - seafood
    - soy
    - wheat
  - diets:
    - vegetarian
    - vegan

## Motivation

The idea for an ingredients reader came about when I thought about how often I 
read ingredients labels as a vegan and the amount of times I misread the label,
only to find out after I had already bought the product.

After discovering that there did not seem to be any good apps on
iOS/Android/GitHub that did this exact thing, I believed it would be an
excellent app idea to try out at the [Platterz
Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/platterz-hackathon-tickets-42682237722#),
where the theme was food-related.
